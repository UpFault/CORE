# CORE

CORE is a spigot multi-purpose plugin with many customization features(not added yet), aimed at being the "CORE" of your spigot server, it provides many features such as, animated BossBars, animated scoreboards, Lobby/Hub Protection with features that you can enable/disable, Lobby Parkour, as-well as many other features which are listed below. To keep down on Lag/File Size I've optimized the code as much as possible.

## Installation

Currently there is no way to install the plugin as its too unstable to have any sort of release I may put out a alpha version in the coming days/weeks depending on how stress testing goes.
## Features
* BossBar
* Scoreboard
* Hub/Lobby Protection
* Help Commands, Rank Commands, Build/Destroy Commands(allows players with the correct permissions to break or build blocks in restricted zones)
## Work in Progress
Below is a list of features which are currently semi-working/not working

* Ranks: Ranks are currently semi-working and have working permission nodes I still have to add ways to allow server admins to add their own ranks through a config, aswell as customizing them.
* Leveling System: Currently this does not work not much else I can say about it at this time.
## Future Plans
I do plan to release this plugin as a full release hopefully near the end of 2023, I have lots of plans and updates/features I wanna add. This project has kept me motivated to keep on programming to hopefully turn this into a career I've been working with the Spigot API for roughly 3-4 years now, the start was quite rough having no knowledge of java, when I eventually decided to take an online course(which I could use a refreshed so I might do it again).

## Platform and Development
CORE is developed on  [Paper](https://papermc.io/) a Fork of Spigot's API, and uses Maven as a compiler, the "Project" is quite fresh as it was only started on 1/30/23 and has a rough estimate of 25+ hours into it.
## Contributing

Currently I'm not accepting any contributions, but if you have ideas, or find bugs when the plugin is in open-alpha/beta feel free to make a request as it's highly appreciated.
