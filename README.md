# CORE

CORE is a spigot multi-purpose plugin with many customization features(not added yet), aimed at being the "CORE" of your spigot server, it provides many features such as, animated BossBars, animated scoreboards, Lobby/Hub Protection with features that you can enable/disable, Lobby Parkour, as-well as many other features which are listed below. To keep down on Lag/File Size I've optimized the code as much as possible.

## Installation

Currently there is no way to install the plugin as its too unstable to have any sort of release I may put out a alpha version in the coming days/weeks depending on how stress testing goes.
